#  n.b. browsers will throw red-screen warnings unless you manage a private CA,
#  use it to sign this listener's certificate, and install it on all of your clients.
#
#  However, considering that we're trying to block the content anyway, giving
#  client's a red-screen warning is probably just as effective as the blocked page.
